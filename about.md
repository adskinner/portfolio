![Allison Skinner Web Design and Development Athens, GA][1]

>Hi, welcome to Allison Skinner Web Design and Development. I’m Allison Skinner, the one-woman show running the business.

I design and build websites (want to learn more about what it means to be a web designer and developer? keep reading [here](/writing/3-key-benefits-of-being-a-designer-and-developer).) For other services, like logo design, photography and copywriting, I partner with other independent creatives in the area (who are they? keep reading here).

I started this business in 2016 after unexpectedly losing an agency job as a web developer. I had a choice to either get another job, or to make my side-hustle freelancing a full-time business. My dad said, “what do you have to lose?” and honestly there wasn’t much to lose. I was a year out of college with no money (but minimal debt), and I knew how to make a great website.

Now 2.5 years later (December 2018), I can say that losing my job was the best thing that ever happened to me. I’m my own boss and that means I wake up without an alarm, wear pajamas to work, have my pugs by my side and work very, very hard for my clients everyday (Learn more about how I started my business [here](/writing/One-Year-Full-Time-Freelancing-What-Ive-Learned-Pt-1)).

Home is Athens, Georgia. I moved here from Iowa when I was 8 years old with my family, grew up here and then went to UGA (Go Dawgs!). I graduated in 2015 and since then I have proudly made a life for myself in Athens.

In fall 2017, my boyfriend and I renovated a 1970s A-Frame blocks from downtown. That’s where we live with our two pugs, Daisy and Cooper. We love to walk downtown for a game of pool at Max or popcorn and cocktails at Manhattan. We also love to walk to [The Grit](https://www.thegrit.com/) for breakfast on the weekdays.

When I’m not making websites, you can find me tending to my vegetable garden, tackling a new recipe in the kitchen or trying to get some exercise after sitting in front of my desk all day (I love bootcamp classes at [Total Training Center](http://totaltrainingcenter.com/) and yoga at [Fuel Hot Yoga](http://www.fuelhotyoga.com/)).

Entrepreneurialism must run in the family because my father, Paul Skinner, will be opening a craft brewery, [Athentic Brewing Company](https://athenticbrewing.com), in June 2019 in the normaltown neighborhood of Athens, Ga.  Check out their [website](https://athenticbrewing.com) (that I made of course!) and make sure to come get a beer when you’re in town.

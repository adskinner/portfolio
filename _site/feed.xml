&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I recently just filed my taxes for 2018. This will be my fourth year filing taxes post-college and also my fourth year filing taxes as “sole proprietor” (aka freelancer).
When filing and saving for taxes as a sole proprietor, it’s a little different than being a full-time employee of a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s different because ZERO money is taken out for taxes when you are being paid as an independent contractor or freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So when tax time comes around, you have to claim &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the money you’ve made and then pay taxes on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that money you’ve made. This likely means you’ll owe thousands and thousands of dollars in taxes. If you don’t have that money already saved, taxes could be a huge hit to your finances and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With good, smart and militant habits, I’ve always had plenty of money saved for taxes and the money I owe has never been a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-away-30-of-every-single-check-you-get-into-an-escrow-account-i-mean-it-every-single-one&quot;&gt;Put away 30% of every single check you get into an escrow account. I mean it! Every. Single. One.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be hard to stomach. I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time I got paid as a freelancer was with a $1,500 check. I remember holding it in my hands and being like “ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FREAKING DOLLARS!!!”
That’s a lot for someone a few months out of college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom works at an investment/banking office down the street from me, so I skipped into her office to deposit my first BIG check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She took the check, punched a few numbers into her calculator and said, “Good job, Allison! I’ll just take out $450 for taxes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“WHAT!” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom then explained to me that this &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; check was actually a lie. It wasn’t worth $1,500. It was worth $1,050. And that $450 would go into a separate account called an “escrow account” and it would sit there, untouched, until I paid my taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty upset, and I had a new found comraderie with all the older people I heard grumbling about “taxes” my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back this is one of best lessons I learned about my finances and I was lucky that I learned it with my &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; freelancing check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of freelancers/young professionals that think their $1,500 checks ARE $1,500 checks and they spend every single penny. Then they file their taxes and they owe thousands of dollars they don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now every time I deposit a check, I take out 30% &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t even think about it! Once the money lands in my escrow account I don’t even consider it my own money anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-cant-afford-to-put-away-30-of-every-check-you-make-then-you-should-be-charging-more&quot;&gt;If you can’t afford to put away 30% of every check you make, then you should be charging more.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start saving for taxes, you will never look at money the same way again! I look at all money with 30% taken out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m putting together a quote, I’ll take the final amount and subtract 30%. Do I still like the amount? Am I still being fairly compensated with 30% taken out? Can I pay my bills and get groceries with 30% taken out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my answer is no, I raise the amount. It may &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like I’m overcharging my client, but every business – every person! – has to pay taxes! Like Benjamin Franklin said, “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-a-cpa&quot;&gt;Get a CPA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing your taxes as a freelancer isn’t as easy for people that have one full-time job with one company. Freelancers typically have mulitple 1099s and lots of business deductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we run the risk of paying &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; in taxes, having a good CPA is a worthy investment. A CPA will not only file your taxes for you, but will also give advice and counseling on how to run your business at a lower tax cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-an-ein-employee-identifcation-number&quot;&gt;Get an EIN (Employee Identifcation Number)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An EIN can be used in place of your social security number on business tax forms (W-9s, 1099s). I like to keep my social security number private, so I provide my EIN for all my business-related tax forms. This can prevent identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also need an EIN if you wish to apply for a business loan or open business bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can apply for an EIN online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-the-irs-know-im-getting-paid&quot;&gt;How does the IRS know I’m getting paid?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you provide a professional service for a client (photography, logo design, something like that) and you get paid for it. The client you did work for will likely want to claim that cost as a business deduction on their taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your client paid you MORE than $600, they have to issue a 1099 to claim that tax deduction. In order to issue a 1099 they need to have your name, address and social security or employee identification number. A client will request this information from you with a W-9 form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the client has a signed W-9 from you, they will send you and the IRS a copy of a 1099.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That 1099 is evidence that you were paid X amount and you will owe taxes on that X amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-if-i-got-paid-less-than-600-for-my-professional-services&quot;&gt;What if I got paid LESS than $600 for my professional services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were paid &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than $600 for a professional service, the client that paid you won’t have to issue a 1099 to claim the cost as a business deduction. That means that there isn’t an official paper trail with the IRS that you were paid that amount. It may be tempting to not claim that payment you received because then you won’t have to pay taxes on it. However, if you were ever audited by the IRS and they found evidence of you being paid and not claiming it, then you will be in legal trouble. Not worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-if-i-dont-receive-1099s-for-everything-i-was-paid-in-the-past-year&quot;&gt;What if I don’t receive 1099s for everything I was paid in the past year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you did get paid &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; $600 for a number of projects, but you’ve only received &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; 1099s from your clients. It’s not your responsibility to make sure there’s a 1099 attached to every penny you’ve made in a year. If a client wants to claim you as a business expense, it’s their responsibility to issue a 1099. However, it is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; responsibility to claim &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the money you’ve made in the past year, whether or not there are 1099s backing up everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re honest about what you’ve made, then there will be no trouble if you’re ever audited by the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;know-what-you-can-deduct-on-your-taxes&quot;&gt;Know what you can deduct on your taxes.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a freelancer that also means that you are a business owner. That means that you can make tax deductions for your business. This is a great opportunity to lower your tax costs. Instead of owing a full 30% of your income, with smart deductions, you could owe less!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of things I deduct from my taxes each year, but I also recommend speaking to your CPA about what deductions are possible for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;here-are-some-things-you-should-claim-as-deductions-on-your-taxes&quot;&gt;Here are some things you should claim as deductions on your taxes:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your rent or mortgage (if you work from home)&lt;/strong&gt;
If you work from home, even part-time, you should be getting a partial deduction on your rent or mortgage. You will need to know the square feet of your entire home and the square feet of your office. This will help determine what percentage of your rent/mortgage can be deducted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your utilities (if you work from home)&lt;/strong&gt;
You need power, water and wifi to run your business! So deduct it!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your phone bill.&lt;/strong&gt;
Do you talk to clients on the phone? Well, then your phone is a business asset and your monthly phone bill should be part of your deductions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your health insurance.&lt;/strong&gt;
As a business owner, you can 100% deduct your health insurance premium! This was the difference between me choosing poor and decent healthcare for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving to and from your office and/or client meetings.&lt;/strong&gt;
For driving deductions, you will submit the mileage you’ve driven for business purposes.
You should keep a detailed log of each “business” drive with your destination and number of miles driven.
This can apply to IRL client meetings or drives to your office (if you have an office outside your home).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any subscriptions/memberships that are business related.&lt;/strong&gt;
For me this is my Dropbox, Adobe Creative Cloud and GitHub Pro accounts. I claim these all as deductions.
As a developer, this can also include any premium plugins, hosting plans, domain names, etc. that I have purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office Equipment / Supplies&lt;/strong&gt;
This includes your laptop computer, desktop computer, desk, headphones, trackpad, keyboard, etc. Also small things like notebooks, pens, etc.
I bought a laptop and desktop computer my first year freelancing and it provided a sizable deduction in my taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any services that you subcontract&lt;/strong&gt;
Freelancers paying freelancers! I’ve subcontracted logo design, photography and copywriting for certain projects. I’ve also had a paid intern. If you’ve paid someone for a professional service over $600 and you’d like to claim it as a deduction on your taxes, you will need to for that independent professional to complete a W-9 form. If you are currently a freelancer, you’ve likely filled out a W-9 form before. Once you have a W-9 from the professional, you can file and send a 1099.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-receiptsdocumentation-for-all-of-your-business-deductions&quot;&gt;Have receipts/documentation for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your business deductions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you file your taxes and claim your deductions, the IRS will not require receipt or documentation of the purchases you’ve claimed. &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, you should have receipt/documentation for everything in case you are audited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to keep track of paper receipts, so I try to have an email receipt record of everything I pay for. It can also be helpful to have a separate business-only credit card. That way you have a full record of business costs on &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pay-quarterly-taxes&quot;&gt;Pay Quarterly Taxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your taxes by the end of the fiscal year (April), you can opt to pay your taxes quarterly. Your CPA will set-up an estimated amount for your quarterly taxes. This is based on your past income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest paying quarterly taxes as a freelancer because it allows you to pay your taxes throughout the year instead of paying a huge sum at the end of the year. Since none of my income is taxed initially, my escrow account will get to be a sizable amount pretty quickly. Instead of having that money sit in my account “burning a hole in my pocket”, I want to flush it out quarterly with tax payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarterly tax amounts are based on an &lt;em&gt;estimate&lt;/em&gt; of what your taxes will be for the year. So that means once you file your taxes, your CPA will review if you owe any extra money for taxes or if you are eligible for a tax return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my experiences, if you have a lot of money left in your escrow after paying all of your quarterly taxes, you’ll likely owe a good bit for taxes. Honestly, that’s something you should be proud of! You had a successful year. But if your escrow account is fairly depleted, you are more likely to break even or possibly get a tax return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-learning-each-year&quot;&gt;Keep learning each year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year I have the goal of becoming smarter about my taxes and learning something new that could save me money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I’m filing my first 1099s for work I’ve contracted out. So, I’ve learned about how to get those costs claimed and deducted. I also learned that my health insurance is deductible!
CPAs are available year round for you to “bend their ear” about possible deductions, changes in tax law and how to properly classify your business.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Allison Skinner</name></author><category term="taxes" /><summary type="html">See the Pen Floating 3D Cube HTML &amp;amp; CSS by Allison Skinner (@adskinner) on CodePen.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/writing/19-03-28/taxes.gif" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Is Jekyll the right platform for your website?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writing/is-jekyll-the-right-platform-for-your-website" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is Jekyll the right platform for your website?" /><published>2019-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writing/is-jekyll-the-right-platform-for-your-website</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writing/is-jekyll-the-right-platform-for-your-website">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s start by learning some basics…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-jekyll&quot;&gt;What is Jekyll?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-static-site-generator&quot;&gt;What is a static site generator?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static site generator compiles your text, css and javascript files and spits out a templated website of static HTML files &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; a database. A CMS, like Wordpress, holds your content in a database and the server will query the database(s) to generate HTML files for your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to continue reading about what static site generators are, I think David Walsh provides a great explanation in his article, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Static Site Generators&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Walsh says static site generators “can be for everyone, just not for everything”. Anyone can setup and manage a Jekyll website, but is a Jekyll website the right fit for their business? I’m going to try to answer that for you today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jekyll-is-not-the-right-fit-for-you-if&quot;&gt;Jekyll IS NOT the right fit for you if…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-you-want-real-time-content-on-your-website&quot;&gt;1. You want real-time content on your website.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of real-time content is a “popular posts” block that lists the most viewed articles today, a “recommended articles” block based on what you’ve been reading. This real-time content is possible through a database.
If this type of content is important to you, then Jekyll is likely not the best fit for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-you-want-to-run-an-online-store&quot;&gt;2. You want to run an online store.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running an online store requires a database for multiple reasons – customer profiles, customer orders, products, coupons, etc. Also you need to be able to link third-party payment methods like Square, Paypal, Stripe, etc. to your website. If you want to run an online shop, I’d recommend Wordpress or Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add that if you only want to sell a few items or you are simply trying to raise donations, Jekyll could still be an appropriate fit for you. You can embed paypal buttons to your website. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/kyle-rush-reveals-how-the-obama-campaign-broke-every-online-fundraising-record-free-mozcon-video&quot;&gt;Barack Obama raised $250 million of donations through his Jekyll 2012 campaign website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-you-want-a-ui-user-interface-to-be-able-to-manageupdate-your-website&quot;&gt;3. You want a UI (user interface) to be able to manage/update your website.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a UI is important for website managers that have limited technical experience. A UI allows you to have dashboard with clear buttons that say “add new post” or “add new page”. A UI allows you to have a content editor to format text. A UI allows you to push your changes by clicking the “publish now” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with Jekyll, you won’t have a UI. To add a new post, you won’t be clicking any clearly labelled buttons. Instead, you will add a markdown file to your “posts” folder and then push your changes to your live repo. This could be a little overwhelming to some, but I think these skills that can be quickly learned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jekyll-is-the-right-fit-for-you-if&quot;&gt;Jekyll IS the right fit for you if…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-your-website-is-relatively-simple&quot;&gt;1. Your website is relatively simple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say your website is relatively simple if your site only needs a few informational pages (“about” page for example), a blog and a contact page with a contact form. That’s essentially how simple my website is! If you don’t need real-time content, a robust online store or user-generated content…then yes, Jekyll could be a great option for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-you-want-your-website-to-run-fast&quot;&gt;2. You want your website to run FAST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static site generators, like Jekyll, typically load 10x faster than a CMS website. My most image-heavy pages load in under 1.2 seconds. That is unbeatable speed compared to Wordpress or Squarespace site loads. This could be especially beneficial to websites that have many large, high-resolution images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-you-want-a-secure-website&quot;&gt;3. You want a secure website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most hackers use database exploits to hack your website. Without a database, the possibility for hacking is greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-you-want-version-control-for-your-entire-website-content-and-code&quot;&gt;4. You want version control for your entire website (content and code)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Jekyll, you can manage your entire site from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;git repository&lt;/a&gt;. (You can also host it for free with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;!) This is a developer standard for most projects, but usually the actual content (posts, pages, images) sits in a database that’s completely separate from your repository. On a jekyll site, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your content will be in your git repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ok-i-want-a-jekyll-website-for-my-business-now-what&quot;&gt;Ok I want a Jekyll website for my business, now what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get started on your own, visit Jekyll’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and get started with their documentation. I’d also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&amp;amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&quot;&gt;Mike Dane’s youtube series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Why didn’t I build my website in Wordpress or Drupal? (Because that’s what I build most of my client websites with)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my clients, I primarily build websites on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.com&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;. I love working on these platforms because it gives my clients with limited technical expertise the ability to update and manage their own websites.
However, I do have the technical experience to update/edit my personal website without any admin interface or user dashboard. I wanted a lean publishing platform that would allow for me push changes and manage a blog with ease – that’s why I chose Jekyll!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-why-jekyll-whats-so-great-about-it&quot;&gt;2. Why Jekyll? What’s so great about it.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator. A static site has no database, it’s really just turning simple markup (text, images, etc.) into a web page. You install Jekyll into a Git repo, add some files, push the changes and &lt;em&gt;voila&lt;/em&gt; there’s your website. The lack of a database is impossible for some businesses (online shops) but can be beneficial for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll-has-a-variety-of-benefits&quot;&gt;Jekyll has a variety of benefits…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They load super fast.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A database-less static website usually loads 10x faster than a website with a CMS. Wow!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For example, even the most image-heavy pages of my website load in under 1.2 seconds. That’s a speed a Wordpress site could only dream of!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are very secure&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Since a Jekyll website is only serving static files there are no scripting or database security exploits possible for hackers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEO benefits&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wordpress and other CMS have a lot of SEO tools, but they don’t have this level of site speed on their side. And Google loves fast websites! Also, it’s easier to maintain a clean file path structure in Jekyll (in my opinion) and Google loves clean file path structures.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built-in blogging platform.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Jekyll has blogging functionality out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Adding a blog post is as simple as adding a markdown file to your posts folder. There is no content editor or admin dashboard to deal with!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has SASS compiler pre-installed.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;SASS can be fairly straightforward to write, but setting up a server-compatible compiler is sometimes not that easy. Luckily, Jekyll has your SASS compiler already set up for you.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can serve website on local computer&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you want to view your Jekyll site before publishing to the production, all you have to do is run “jekyll serve” from your terminal. It will run your SASS compiler and all the other Jekyll magic and serve your website on your local IP.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built with liquid&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Liquid is PHP’s more attractive cousin and it’s a lot of fun to code in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Layouts” and “Includes” allow for fast building&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are building a raw HTML site and you need to add a new page, you’ll have to copy over the head, header, main menu, footer, etc. It’s a tedious process and makes changes/updates to your code difficult to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Jekyll has support for ‘layouts’ and ‘includes’. ‘Layouts’ allow you to create a structure for different page templates, such as ‘posts’ or ‘portfolio examples’.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“Includes” are like blocks, they are snippets of HTML that you can &lt;em&gt;include&lt;/em&gt; anywhere on your site. If you ever update your “layout” or an “include”, it’ll update sitewide.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-why-host-on-github-pages&quot;&gt;3. Why host on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The simplest answer is that it’s FREE.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Most hosting plans start at least at $10/month, but decent hosting plans are usually $35/month or higher. So with Github pages, I’m saving hundreds of dollars a year. (GH Pages is only compatible with static sites, so this isn’t free hosting for all!)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The SSL certificate is free &amp;amp; pre-installed.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All Github Pages hosted websites have a free, automatic SSL certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can manage your website directly from your git repo.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once you push your changes to your gh-pages branch, it’s pushed to your production site. Easy as that!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In August 2016, I launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://allisondskinner.com&quot;&gt;allisondskinner.com&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I thought it was going to be a basic portfolio site that would garner a few freelance clients to supplement my full-time job income. However, two days after launching my portfolio site, I didn’t have a full-time job anymore and now my portfolio website represented my full-time business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you want to learn more about my origin story, &lt;a href=&quot;/writing/One-Year-Full-Time-Freelancing-What-Ive-Learned-Pt-1&quot;&gt;keep reading here&lt;/a&gt;.) I’m proud of my 2016 portfolio because it brought me solid, recurring business for over two years, but there were some flaws with the site.
By 2018, I wanted to redo my portfolio site because my business had evolved in so many ways and because the site was such a pain to update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-following-were-the-main-issues-i-had-with-my-2016-portfolio-website&quot;&gt;The following were the main issues I had with my 2016 portfolio website:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-i-bought-a-premium-html-theme-for-my-portfolio-website&quot;&gt;1. I bought a premium HTML theme for my portfolio website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means, I didn’t truly design my portfolio website and I didn’t write all the code. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://themeforest.net/item/sartre-creative-multipurpose-html-template/13912008&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; I bought, if you’re interested! This was the best choice for my skill level at the time, but two years later it was an internal embarrassment. I design and build custom themes for all my clients, so my portfolio should reflect that level of craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-being-a-raw-html-website-there-was-nothing-dynamic-about-the-website-and-it-was-tedious-to-manage-a-blog&quot;&gt;2. Being a raw HTML website, there was nothing dynamic about the website and it was tedious to manage a blog.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to publish a blog post, not only did I have to hand code the post, but then I had to hand code it into my blog feed, the mini blog feed on my homepage and on the ‘recent posts’ sidebar on every past blog post. With a little PHP (or liquid or twig) that could all be done dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-i-cater-to-everyone-in-how-i-market-and-describe-my-business&quot;&gt;3. I cater to everyone in how I market and describe my business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I launched my business, I was available and interested in any web project — any budget, any industry, any deadline. This is a good business plan if you need a lot of business asap, but it’s not very good if you want to become an expert in any niche type of website design or development. Now, I want my portfolio website to appeal to my dream clients – which are creative, hard-working businesses that need a website to work hard for them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-main-goals-for-my-new-2019-portfolio-site-are-the-following&quot;&gt;My main goals for my new 2019 portfolio site are the following:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-a-unique-experimental-design-that-i-usually-dont-have-the-opportunity-to-designbuild-for-a-client&quot;&gt;1. A unique, experimental design that I usually don’t have the opportunity to design/build for a client&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2016 portfolio design is mostly based off the HTML theme I purchased, for my new 2019 portfolio website I wanted it to be 100% Allison through and through. Bright colors, split page navigation, bold typography. I wanted my portfolio website to appeal to creative businesses that don’t want a cookie-cutter website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-an-easier-way-to-write-and-share-blog-posts&quot;&gt;2. An easier way to write and share blog posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing for my old portfolio site, it was so tedious to publish anything — think raw html, copying and pasting the same blocks of code over and over again from page to page. For my new portfolio website, I didn’t want a bloated CMS but I knew I had to have some kind of platform that I could manage a blog easily from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-keep-my-high-seo-rankings-and-fast-page-load-times&quot;&gt;3. Keep my high SEO rankings and fast page load times.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two big things that worked on my portfolio website was that it ranked well on google search results and that it loaded really fast. I can attribute this to having a raw HTML website with no heavy CMS or database to load. It was clean, lean code and google rewarded me for it. And I want to keep it that way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After reviewing my goals for my next portfolio site, the path was clear for me — I wanted to build a static site with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and host it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. What is Jekyll and why am I using it for my portfolio website? What does it mean to host with github pages?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s December 2018 and it’s cold and wet in Georgia, which is as close as it’ll ever get to a wintry wonderland. With the year winding down, I’m thinking of what’s ahead.
My only short term goal is to finish what I can and then relax with friends and family. After thanksgiving, I don’t take on new work. My only goal is to finish it!
The best thing about a new year is that it’s a chance to start fresh. You can look back on what you did and didn’t accomplish in 2018 and then make new goals for 2019. &lt;a href=&quot;/writing/2018-A-Year-In-Review&quot;&gt;Check out my 2018 Year in Review post here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bizness-goals&quot;&gt;Bizness goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-share-my-work-more&quot;&gt;1. Share my work more&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t shared new work since November 2017. Which is right about the time I got overbooked for a full year and decided my portfolio site was too outdated to even update. I’m thankful that I still get business without updating my portfolio, but I wonder what business I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be getting if I did update it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-share-and-write-more-about-myself-and-my-business&quot;&gt;2. Share and write more about myself and my business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freelancers &amp;amp; studios that I connect with the most are the ones that, unsurprisingly, share the most. I want potential clients that are unsure about getting a website redesign to follow me, get to know me and maybe a few months later…bite the bullet and contact me about their website! I also want people in the industry, especially those starting out, to follow my writing for motivation and advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-expand-my-client-base-to-atlanta&quot;&gt;3. Expand my client base to Atlanta&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athens, GA is my home, I love it here and I’m grateful to say that most of clients live and work here as well! Athens is a small town that’s bustling with creative &amp;amp; entrepreneurial activity — and I get to make the websites that showcase it. I want to expand to more Atlanta clients because it means bigger clients and bigger projects, and even creative projects with healthy budgets 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-spend-time-to-improve-workflows&quot;&gt;4. Spend time to improve workflows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you work alone, it’s easy to find a way that works and stick with that…forever. Even if there’s a faster, better way to do it. I want to make time to try out new workflows and approaches. It’ll be more time intensive on the frontend, but could lead to great improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-spend-time-experimenting-and-playing-with-design-and-code&quot;&gt;5. Spend time experimenting and playing with design and code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to play! Like a kid in sandbox; trying out new effects, languages and designs. I think I’m in a creative rut. I know how to make an attractive, well-functioning website but sometimes I feel like my work creatively bleeds together, re-using the same tricks and designs from website to website. Most of my clients don’t want the weird stuff, but that doesn’t mean it can’t play around with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-goals&quot;&gt;Personal goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-health-allison&quot;&gt;1. Health Allison!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Allison was in full-swing in 2018 and I intend to continue that into 2019. I call this new lifestyle “Health Allison” because it really takes a persona shift to get in shape and get healthy. I gained some weight and lost some energy when I graduated college and began working a desk job. In 2018, I started taking bootcamp classes at my local gym and joined a hot yoga studio. I’ve lost 10 lbs to date and I feel stronger overall. My focus in 2019 will be to continue exercising but incorporate healthier eating into my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-travel-more&quot;&gt;2. Travel More&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to go to the west coast and abroad in 2019. I’ve never been to the west coast…I don’t think I’ve even seen the Pacific Ocean! So that’s high on the list. I also want to travel abroad, haven’t been out of the country since my study abroad to Argentina in 2014. My mom and I really want to go to England and Scotland to tour ALL the castles, we are BBC fanatics.
I already have a trip to Asheville in Feburary planned with my family. Spending two nights at the Grove Park Inn with Jeff for spa &amp;amp; relaxation and then we’re heading to downtown Asheville for two nights with our family for lots of beer and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-grow-an-incredible-vegetable-garden&quot;&gt;3. Grow an Incredible Vegetable Garden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I tried out gardening for the first time with two raised vegetable beds and I had a lot of success (with a few failures). I want to take full advantage of Georgia’s blessedly long growing seasons and expand my gardening. My dream is to possibly stop spending a fortune at the grocery store because I grow so much on my own! The biggest revelation I had about gardening is that you can buy an 80 cent pack of salad green seeds and have overflowing amounts of salad greens for months. Whereas at the grocery store you can spend $4 on a small handful of greens!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Allison Skinner</name></author><category term="2019" /><category term="goals" /><summary type="html">2019 What’s to Come It’s December 2018 and it’s cold and wet in Georgia, which is as close as it’ll ever get to a wintry wonderland.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2018-a-year-in-review&quot;&gt;2018: A Year in review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2018 marks the year where I really got used to running a business. I’m now 2.5 years in, and it feels normal. I wake up, make coffee, walk the dogs and then sit down at my desk to start work. When I started my business, everything felt novel — working in my pajamas, having no boss, walking over to my couch for an afternoon nap. It felt like I was breaking the rules at a real career. Now, a few years later and still making it, this is what I do and it feels right. I’m not going anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;january&quot;&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My year begin at full-speed. I had a client list as long as my arm and everyone wanted their website built and launched yesterday. Five months earlier I overbooked myself and I still wasn’t caught up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes down as my biggest launch to date. We started the conversation of re-doing the School of Art’s website back in August 2015 and two years later we launched it. Does it take me two years to build a website? No. Can it take that long for the wheels of bureaucracy to allow it? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building and launching this website was smooth sailing. The client loved the design, got me content quickly and, before I knew it, we launched the site! If only every launch could go like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;launched-inkwood-books-at-inkwoodbookscom-and-inkwoodbooksnjcom&quot;&gt;Launched Inkwood Books at &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkwoodbooks.com&quot;&gt;inkwoodbooks.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkwoodbooksnj.com&quot;&gt;inkwoodbooksnj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/writing/18-12-08/inkwood-books.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inkwood Books&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that bookstore websites have become my niche. Inkwood Books has a location in Tampa, Florida and Haddonfield, New Jersey and they are run by two sisters! It was great working with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;launched-velveteen-pink-at-velveteen-pinkcom&quot;&gt;Launched Velveteen Pink at &lt;a href=&quot;http://velveteen-pink.com&quot;&gt;velveteen-pink.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/writing/18-12-08/vp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Velveteen Pink&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website is different and weird. I loved making this site for one of my favorite Athens bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avidbookshop.com/book/9780345803788&quot;&gt;Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I thought I was going to finally catch up and get a break this month LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;launched-winterville-station-at-wintervillestationcom&quot;&gt;Launched Winterville Station at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wintervillestation.com&quot;&gt;wintervillestation.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me started on real estate websites, which I love making because it combines my hobby of house hunting and website building together. I really admire the genius of JW York Homes for seeing the potential for incredible, fairly priced homes in Winterville, GA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joined the gym and started a 2x a week bootcamp class. We lived at my parents for half of 2017 during house renovations and a wonderfully stocked fridge took it’s toll!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planted my first vegetable garden (with lots of help from my Grandma!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/writing/18-12-08/athentic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Athentic Brewing Company&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad and his business partner Mark are opening a brewery (expected opening June 2019) and of course I made the website because I’m the kid that makes websites in the family. I loved being able to do something for my dad after everything he’s done for me growing up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avidbookshop.com/book/9781101970348&quot;&gt;The Nix by Nathan Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;may&quot;&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fired my first client.&lt;/strong&gt; This was a big learning experience for me. I really liked my client as a person, loved her business and admired her as a business owner. However, the work environment was toxic and stressful with no end in sight. The money was good, but my days were horrible. When I got the website launched, I ended work with that client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trip to New York City with 8 women in my family 😮 that’s a lot of us, I know, but we had so much fun.

&lt;p&gt;This was my second UGA website and my second biggest launch (which I did while I was in NYC with my family!) When I was approached for this website, I immediately knew how I wanted it to look and feel. It all came together and I’m really proud of this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturn Booksellers, located in Gaylord, MI, won a small business contest and received funding for them to use as they wished — and they wanted a new website! After seeing my work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://avidbookshop.com&quot;&gt;Avid Bookshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://inkwoodbooks.com&quot;&gt;Inkwood Books&lt;/a&gt;, they contacted me to update their site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Went to Charleston for five days with my best friend Dani to dogsit my brother’s dog. I will drop anything at anytime to dogsit in Charleston — who wouldn’t??&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got overbooked in early August 2017 and it took an entire year of full-throttle working to get everything done. I made good money but I didn’t have the quality of life I wanted. I found that my whole thinking brain was consumed by work. July marked the beginning of my second half of 2018 — where I slowed things down, relaxed and was mindful to not get overbooked again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added a second pug to our family, Cooper, a 3 year old pug from the Rescue Ranch.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/writing/18-12-08/cooper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cooper the pug&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Look at this cute pug named cooper!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His original owners wanted to use him as a stud for breeding, but when that didn’t work out they surrendered him. Jeff and I are so lucky Cooper is in our lives. We love him (and Daisy!) so so much.&lt;/p&gt;

I also started a new Drupal 8 redesign of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.uga.edu&quot;&gt;Lamar Dodd website&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I the site launched only six months prior but I’ve always got new ideas for Lamar Dodd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started an 8 week pottery wheel class. I wanted to start a hobby that was far from the computer. Turns out I’m pretty terrible at pottery, but I’m glad I took the class!

&lt;p&gt;Started hot yoga again after not going for 3 years. Began to combine 2-3 bootcamp classes a week with 2-3 yoga classes. Health has become a new focus of 2018.

&lt;p&gt;I built this website back in June, but it took awhile for all the content to come together for the site’s launch. By December, we were determined to launch the site, so we wrapped up the final tweaks and launched it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World of Pearl is a niche website that focuses on the international pearl travels of India Rows, The Pearl Girls founder &amp;amp; CEO. It’s been really interesting to learn more about pearls and how India started a successful online pearl jewelry business. My work on The World of Pearl led to work on their main ecommerce site &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepearlgirls.com&quot;&gt;The Pearl Girls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2018-had-two-distinct-halves&quot;&gt;2018 had two distinct halves.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half was a flurry of work and site launches. I got an incredible amount of work done and I’m really proud of myself. However, the consequence was I got burnt out and needed a complete reset.
The second half of my 2018 has been marked by mindful work balance and growth. I’ve kept going with work, but I have time to make dinner, see friends, work out. I can take my dogs on a walk and think about absolutely nothing — mind clear. I’m in a really good place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-things-im-really-proud-of-in-2018&quot;&gt;Other things I’m really proud of in 2018.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on my health, something I’ve never done before!&lt;/strong&gt; This is the first time in my life that I’ve kept up with a workout routine for longer than six months (bootcamp classes at &lt;a href=&quot;http://totaltrainingcenter.com/&quot;&gt;Total Training Center&lt;/a&gt;). I’ve also started hot yoga again at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fuelhotyoga.com/&quot;&gt;Fuel Hot Yoga&lt;/a&gt; after a 3 year hiatus. My body is sore all the time — it feels like I’m achingly growing a new body.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Becoming more environmentally friendly.&lt;/strong&gt; This year I really started to notice the waste around me, and how I contribute to it. Once you really see it, it’s shocking. I’ve become a lot better at using reusable cups and bags. I try to make most of my food from whole, bulk ingredients instead of food that comes in disposable packaging. Less meat or meat that’s local/ethically produced. And more…continuing to learn a lot more on how I can reduce my impact.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are two questions you may be asking yourself: When is it a good time to get a website for my business? or I have a website, but it’s outdated. When should I get a website redesign?
My answer to both of those questions is: &lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a legitimate business you don’t need a storefront or employees (I have neither), but you do need a website. A website makes you credible. A website proves that you’ve got it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, when you have a website you are opening your business to the world, not just your nearby community. You will have more opportunity to gain customers, clients, fans, etc. when you put yourself online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my Freelancing Series , I talked about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/&quot;&gt;1,000 True Fans theory&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, you can make a decent living if you have 1,000 people who will always buy your products because they love what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it be harder to get those true fans within a 15 mile radius or a 25,000 mile radius? (That’s the size of the Earth btw).
Also, social media and search engines are truly the vehicles of success today. If you don’t have a website, less people will find you with a google search. You can make a business profile on social media, but you have limited to no control over the SEO, design and functionality. Not having a website for your business caps off your opportunity for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now we are all agreed. You need a website. What’s Next?
If you have someone specific in mind to make your website, give that person or team a heads up that you are putting a website plan together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am typically booking projects 1-3 months in advance, so if you give me a heads up that you are wanting a website in the near future, I can likely save you spot on the list. Sometimes, I get phone calls from people that need someone to start on their website right now, and I’m just too busy to take it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancers and small teams can quickly get booked up, so start communication early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-its-time-to-start-putting-together-your-website-plan&quot;&gt;Now, it’s time to start putting together your website plan.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A designer/developer can’t provide a quote for your website unless you have a basic plan for your website. There’s been countless times that someone has contacted me about a website, and then I ask them a few standard questions, and within minutes they realize that they don’t even know what they want for their website, or maybe they don’t even know what they want out of their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to have a clear idea of what you want for your website, before you contact a designer/developer or an agency for the job. When you have a clear idea of what you want, we can provide a quote to you. If you just want something that’s “simple, not too many pages, but looks modern and clean” that could mean something different to each person. I think a small website is no more than four pages. Others might think a small website is no more than ten pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heres-your-homework-before-you-start-a-website&quot;&gt;Here’s your homework before you start a website:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have the domain or hosting for your website?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many pages will your website have?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many of those pages will have static content and how many pages will have regularly updated content? I.e: blog posts, events, products for sale, staff members, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a desired deadline?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you know your competition? Who, out of your competition, has a great website?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of people visiting your site? What action do you want them to take? I.e. contact you for a quote or buy a product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have you considered SEO (search engine optimization)? What are some keywords that you’d like your website to rank for?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have images and/or videography for your website?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a logo?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have copy for website? I.e. about page, staff bios, etc.
Once you’ve done your homework, now it’s time to reconnect with the person or team that you first contacted about a website and ask for a quote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a website plan, it’s easier for me to provide a quote and it’s easier for me to start work on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a website is work, not only for me, but also for you, the client. When you hire someone to make your website, you’re not completely off the hook. No one knows your business better than you do, so you want to be involved! A website forces you to get all your ducks in a row — photography, copy, contact information, products ready to be sold.
It proves that you are capable and credible to run a business—to yourself and the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Allison Skinner</name></author><category term="websites" /><category term="website redesign" /><summary type="html">There are two questions you may be asking yourself: When is it a good time to get a website for my business? or I have a website, but it’s outdated.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not common for someone to be a designer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a developer. Typically there is a designer and developer for each project. Two separate people with two separate roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A designer is someone who decides what a website will look like — color, fonts, layout—while a developer is someone who builds the website &amp;amp; makes it actually function. A designer creates mockups for a website and then the developer builds the interactive website based on those mockups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a designer and developer, even before I knew what the distinction meant. When I graduated college, I thought people who “made websites” designed them and then built them. And at my first agency job that’s exactly what I did. I made the mockups for the website and then I built that website. It wasn’t until I went full-time freelancing that people started asking me if I was a designer or a developer. I felt like I had to choose between the two because almost everyone in the industry does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked myself, would I rather design websites or build them? I slept on it and still couldn’t come up with a decision. I loved design and I loved to code, and I didn’t want that to change. Deciding to be a designer and developer made sense to me, and I think it also makes sense for many businesses that need help with a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses typically either hire an agency that has in-house designers and developers or a business hires a freelance designer and a freelance developer to work together and create a website. However, hiring someone who’s a designer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; developer provides benefits beyond only having to hire one person for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-designing-with-code-in-mind&quot;&gt;1. Designing with Code in Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I design mockups for a website, I know exactly how I will build it. Sometimes developers are handed the mockups to websites that were designed to look good but won’t, in reality, function well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors such as page load times, flexibility of device-widths and cross-browser support are sometimes overlooked in design but need to be considered during development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the developer has a challenging tightrope to walk. The developer wants to honor the mockups provided by the designer, but also knows some of the design decisions will affect the website’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time it takes for a developer and designer to work through these issues of design vs. performance can eat up a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I design websites I’m thinking 10 steps ahead. I’m thinking about the unique challenges my design will create when I’m building the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will a client be able to easily update this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How will this feature look on Internet Explorer?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will this page load quickly?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How will this absolute positioned SVG shape look when the device-width changes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many skilled designers these days learn enough about code and CMS frameworks to be able to make design decisions that look and function well. On some projects, I’m solely the developer and a project is always more enjoyable when I work with a designer that at least understands how a website comes together — from the website’s framework to it’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-integration-of-interaction-and-animation&quot;&gt;2. Integration of interaction and animation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design mockups are typically created using static tools — Adobe Photoshop and Sketch — and it makes it difficult for animation, movement &amp;amp; interactivity to be considered and then communicated. Many times mockups only include animation notes for hyperlinks, buttons and menu items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototyping tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt; allow designers to design complex animations, but I still think having experience as a developer helps when it comes to interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer and developer, I design with interactivity in the forefront of my mind. I love to build animations with code and therefore I include it in my designs. I see a website with stunning animations, and it becomes a personal challenge to know how it was made. When a designer creates mockups with static tools it’s challenging to think critically and creatively about how the website will move. As a developer, you know interaction and animation intimately because you build it everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe interaction is the perfect marriage of design and development. It’s best when it’s creative and functions well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-making-a-custom-website-that-a-client-can-maintain&quot;&gt;3. Making a custom website that a client can maintain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a website not only has to look good and function well, many times it also needs to be easily managed &amp;amp; updated by clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a publication site like Man Repeller needs to have a framework that allows any person in the office to easily post an article, gallery or blog post. And when any person hits publish, the finished product should look good every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a durable, flexible and attractive framework is a challenge, and it’s a challenge best suited for someone who has the mind of a designer and developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approach these types of websites development first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first construct a framework that I know will work. All custom functionality needs to be tucked in the backend and the CMS should remain user-friendly. No HTML markup in the text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework needs to be flexible. The design should look good if the article title is one word or ten words, or if the article has no images or twenty images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a user-friendly and flexible framework, then you can add design details that make the website look more unique than an out-of-the-box Wordpress blog. These custom details should not intrude on any user-friendly features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a designer and developer is an indispensable advantage when creating websites that need hands-off maintenance from the clients. I can make a custom, beautiful website that can be updated by any intern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a designer and developer was an easy decision for me because it’s all I know. I have a natural eye for design, while loving the technical challenge of development. At first, I decided to be designer and developer because it felt natural to me, but I soon came to learn that it provides a unique advantage for my clients. My clients also benefit from someone who’s considering functionality, maintenance, performance and interaction from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I design with a developer’s critical eye for functionality and I develop with a designer’s attention to beauty. I wouldn’t have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Allison Skinner</name></author><category term="freelancing" /><category term="web designer" /><category term="web developer" /><category term="devsigner" /><summary type="html">It’s not common for someone to be a designer and a developer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Read part one here to learn how I started full-time freelancing and got through the early obstacles of getting clients and managing a cashflow with no steady paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;months-6-12-ive-got-plenty-of-work-now-what&quot;&gt;Months 6-12: I’ve got plenty of work. Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Feburary 2017, the model of my business shifted. Prospective clients found me and wanted help with their businesses. I didn’t find them and show up on their doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My inbox was full of businesses who needed websites! Woohoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jumped at every opportunity because I finally had the chance to make steady money. I started to buy groceries regularly and I paid off almost all of my debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once I got steady work and steady clients, I realized that a one-woman business can only take on so much work. There are only so many hours in a day! Also, I learned that not every client and every project is ideal for my business. I decided it was time to focus my business goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make amazing websites for dream clients, get a following, meet people in the industry, learn a whole lot and travel abroad for at least one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-forward-goals-for-full-time-freelancing&quot;&gt;Going Forward: Goals for Full-Time Freelancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazing Websites for Dream Clients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every freelancer should know exactly what types of businesses are their dream clients. Even better, a freelancer should have a list of specific businesses that fit this criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dream Client Is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business that wants a creative &amp;amp; innovative website.
A business that knows a unique &amp;amp; well-functioning website is an investment and is willing to pay for that type of investment.
A business that is run by good, genuine people.
Does the above sound like you? Cool! &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;Let’s talk&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to devote my limited time to clients that I am passionate about. I want to create dynamic, innovative websites that push the boundaries in design and development. Many businesses want a simple, no-frills website to get their information online. That makes sense for many businesses starting out. I want to be the designer and developer for businesses that want the website of their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1000-true-fans&quot;&gt;1,000 True Fans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/&quot;&gt;1,000 True Fans theory&lt;/a&gt;, proposed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kk.org/&quot;&gt;Kevin Kelly&lt;/a&gt; in his popular 2008 article “1,000 True Fans”, is the idea that you really only need 1,000 true fans, or “super fans”, to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true fan, by Kevin Kelly’s definition, is someone who will buy any product of yours. They will buy your book in hardback and audio, they will travel a hundred miles to see you speak or perform, they will fund your kickstarter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had 1,000 true fans that would spend $100 on your products/services in a year, then you could make $100,000 just off your true fans. That’s a more than livable income!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every true fan, it’s typical to have a two or three regular fans. A regular fan follows your work, but may only occasionally buy a product of yours. Let’s say you have 1,000 true fans and 2,000 regular fans. A true fan spends $100 on your products each year, but a regular fan only spends $30. With 2,000 regular fans spending $30 per year, you’d make $60,000 in addition to the $100,000 from your true fans. Making $160,000 is an achievable goal and gives you a good quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for the next year is to work towards gaining my 1,000 true fans. I don’t have any products for sale yet, I only provide my services as a web designer and developer. I want to sell a product, or products, in the future, either through my web design and development skills or possibly through a side business. But I don’t want to sell anything until I grow my fan base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1,000 true fans goal may sound a bit profit &amp;amp; numbers focused, but that’s not the main drive for me. The main drive for me is that I want to use my business and brand to connect with people. I am a true fan of many entrepreneurs, freelancers &amp;amp; creators. My relationship with their work, products, and them personally is more important than my relationship with any corporation. When I buy deodorant from CVS it’s not a true fan moment. When you buy a product as a true fan, it’s so much more than exchanging money for goods. You feel like you’re a part of something, you feel connected to that creator! You want to personally thank the creator for making such a great product and then tell everyone about it. I want that for my business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meet-people-in-the-industry-irl&quot;&gt;Meet People in the industry IRL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fourathens.com/&quot;&gt;Four Athens&lt;/a&gt; tech industry Happy Hour last week. I’ve been freelancing as a designer and developer for a whole year, and only last week did I go to a tech happy hour in my hometown. It was a five minute walk from my apartment! And everyone was super nice! Why did it take me so long??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so glad I went because I actually got to meet and talk with people in real life. As someone who works from home (#wfh life) and runs an online business, it’s become hard for me to leave my house. Going to the post office once a week becomes this looming event that I keep pushing off til the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized two things when I went to my first tech meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The true way to gain fans &amp;amp; grow a network is through personal, real-life connections&lt;/strong&gt;
I can tweet all day. I can like &amp;amp; favorite people’s posts. But the way to really gain a presence in the tech industry is to actually be physically present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start small &amp;amp; local through Four Athens.
Then branch into Atlanta tech meetups.
And then start going to at least one or two tech conferences each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t let imposter syndrome stop you&lt;/strong&gt;
I have imposter syndrome, and I want to be more comfortable about it. Imposter syndrome is when you work in an industry but feel like you don’t belong because you don’t think you are as talented as everyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a female journalism major that took a few coding classes in college. I’m a front end developer from a small town in the south. I’m 24 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all things that make me feel teeny tiny compared to the tech bros that have CS majors and have worked for major tech companies on the west coast. Imposter syndrome makes me not want to attend meetups because I’m afraid someone will ask me a question about programming and I won’t know what they are talking about. Then it’ll be obvious that I don’t belong there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, imposter syndrome is now recognized as a real issue in the tech industry. Experienced developers and designers that I look up to are speaking about their own issues with imposter syndrome (example 1, 2 ,3). They are making a point to make everyone feel like they belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clutch to these kind, inspiring words when I enter networking events now. &lt;em&gt;I do belong in this industry. I am talented. It’s okay to feel uncomfortable. It’s okay that I don’t know everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youve-still-have-got-a-lot-to-learn-so-put-real-time-towards-towards-learning-things-deeply&quot;&gt;You’ve still have got a lot to learn. So put real time towards towards learning things deeply.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last January, I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://eloquentjavascript.net/&quot;&gt;textbook&lt;/a&gt; on JavaScript. One of my top New Year’s Resolutions was ‘learn JavaScript deeply’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The textbook has sat, untouched, on my desk for almost seven months. I use custom JavaScript &amp;amp; jQuery on many projects. I write successful code through a myriad of Stack Overflow forums, JSfiddles &amp;amp; tutorials. What I have in the end works, but I wouldn’t say I deeply understand JavaScript &amp;amp; jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I’ve learned that freelancing is not just full-time billable hours of deep work. You also have to run a business (finances &amp;amp; communication) and you have to market your business (blogging &amp;amp; social media). The fourth component that I’m realizing needs dedicated time is education. I need to continue learning to improve my work. Improving my work improves my credibility, which improves my marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learn everyday on the job. Fixing problems &amp;amp; finding solutions is the crux of a developer’s job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’m having a challenging time learning on-the-go when it involves a programming language that I don’t have deep knowledge or experience in. That’s where I want to take a step back and really learn. It’s fascinating how I’ve gone through 20 years of schooling, I have a college degree, and I’ve only scratched the surface on what I will learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;travel-and-work-abroad-for-at-least-one-month&quot;&gt;Travel and work abroad for at least one month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons why I decided to go full-time freelancing is because of the flexibility it provides for vacation time and working remotely. Some freelancers are “digital nomads” that live and work abroad year-round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t plan to work abroad full-time, but I’d like to at least go abroad for a month, possibly two months in 2018. I haven’t had many opportunities to travel in the past year because initially I couldn’t afford to travel and lately I’ve been focused on paying off debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, July 2017, will be the first month I start regularly saving money (!!!), so I hope working abroad will be achievable in the upcoming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m hoping to live and work in Barcelona — I’ve never been to Europe and I’d love to put my Spanish minor to use :) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on getting a two bedroom Airbnb for my stay there, so hopefully friends and family can come visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes my series on “My First Year Full-Tim Freelancing”. This year has been emotional, challenging and rewarding. I thought fulltime freelancing was only possible for professionals that had many years of experience and a large network. I didn’t think it was possible for a 23 year old journalism graduate living in a small southern town to bootstrap her way to running a successful web design and development business. I had no money or clients starting out, but tenacity and the desire to deliver excellent work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a passion that you wish would replace your “real” job? Do you want to freelance, but are scared of not having a steady paycheck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancing may not be for everyone, but I believe it’s an opportunity that is well-suited for those that want ownership of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions on freelancing or running an online business, don’t hesitate to email me. I’d love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Allison Skinner</name></author><category term="freelancing" /><category term="goals" /><summary type="html">Read part one here to learn how I started full-time freelancing and got through the early obstacles of getting clients and managing a cashflow with no steady paycheck.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/writing/17-07-11/ft_freelance2_cover.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">One Year Full-time Freelancing: What I’ve Learned Pt. 1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writing/One-Year-Full-Time-Freelancing-What-Ive-Learned-Pt-1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One Year Full-time Freelancing: What I've Learned Pt. 1" /><published>2017-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writing/One-Year-Full-Time-Freelancing-What-Ive-Learned-Pt-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writing/One-Year-Full-Time-Freelancing-What-Ive-Learned-Pt-1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/img/writing/17-07-05/fulltime_freelanceCover.png&quot; alt=&quot;graphic for One Year Full-Time Freelancing: What I've Learned Pt. 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-all-started&quot;&gt;How it All started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to be a full-time freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a full-time agency job working as a designer &amp;amp; developer. I made websites everyday, and I loved it. It felt powerful to find what I loved to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was only 23 years old, everyone at the office respected the work I did and &lt;em&gt;wanted to know what I thought about things&lt;/em&gt;. In my first year after college, at my first job, I made over a dozen websites, from design to development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I didn’t have a portfolio site, a blog or a twitter account. I kept my head low and churned out the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved up money little by little, and one year into my job I decided it was time to buy a car. I needed to buy a car. My old car couldn’t drive more than four miles without stalling out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took all the money out of my savings and checking account and bought a used Toyota Camry. It wasn’t much, but it took my year of saving down to $4 in my checking account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw how little money I had, and thought “time to do freelancing &lt;em&gt;on the side&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I worked, I was technically paid as a contractor (not as an employee) which saved tax money for the owner. This meant I could pursue freelancing while keeping my full-time (contract) job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put together a portfolio website and told the world I was available for freelance. My plan was to do a few freelancing projects to replenish my savings, but I didn’t think I had the skills or the network to go full-time freelancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days after I went live with my portfolio website, I lost my job. I’m not going to go into details about losing my job here, but I was devastated and shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was, “I need to get a new job”. That’s the typical thought someone has after they lose their job. I need someone to hire me. I updated my LinkedIn. I drafted a new resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave my resume to my dad to proofread, and he said, “Why do you need me to read your resume? You already have a job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dad, I don’t have a job anymore,” I said. “I lost it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” my dad said, “your freelancing is your job now. It’s your business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I only meant to do freelancing on the side. It can’t be my full-time job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why not?” my dad replied. “You don’t have much money, but you also don’t have much debt. You don’t have kids. Your expenses are low. Also you have a good skill. Do you really want to work for the man again? Do you really want to work for a man again?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in that moment I began my full-time freelance business. I had $4 to my name and no clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-month-door-to-door-website-saleswoman&quot;&gt;The First Month: Door to Door Website Saleswoman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first month of full-time freelancing was scary. A roller coaster of emotions. I needed to pay rent and buy food. There was no paycheck coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-your-name-online&quot;&gt;Get Your Name Online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a profile for my business on every social media platform imaginable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/allisonskinnerwebdesign/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skinner_design&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/a.l.l.is.on/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/adskinner&quot;&gt;Behance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/adskinner/&quot;&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adskinner&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@askinner&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. I added my business to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir//allison+skinner/data=!4m6!4m5!1m1!4e2!1m2!1m1!1s0x88f66d24792cd9d1:0x323d2788031bbace?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwim3c_plKfdAhVK3VMKHacaAJQQ9RcwEnoECAwQEw&quot;&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;/writing&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. People needed to know that I made websites and I was available for hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-clients-now&quot;&gt;Get Clients Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no real experience getting clients. When I was working at an agency, I was the girl making websites behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I made a list of every business in Athens &amp;amp; Oconee County that either didn’t have a website or their website needed to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I literally went door to door, to each business, and tried to win clients. I was a door to door website saleswoman. Being out of my comfort zone was an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people took my business card and wished me luck. A few wouldn’t even shake my hand and glowered at me until I left their store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I walked into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avidbookshop.com/&quot;&gt;Avid Bookshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I said I made websites, they immediately responded: “We need a new one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were my first client as a full-time freelancer, and still a cherished client today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;months-2-6-hardly-making-it&quot;&gt;Months 2-6: (Hardly) Making it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next five months, I made it. In the sense that I didn’t go homeless or starve. And here’s how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live Lean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I paid the minimum on all my credit cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ate egg sandwiches and pbjs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I stopped going out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t buy a single article of clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I cancelled all superfluous subscriptions or memberships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t travel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t get haircuts, buy makeup or hair products.
Live tenaciously for your business.
My business was my every waking thought. My desire to dress well, go out or be cool was replaced by my desire to see my business succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal was to deliver excellent work to the few clients I had, in hopes of getting more work through referrals. It worked. Slowly but surely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-30-out-of-every-check-for-taxes-and-raise-your-rates-to-accommodate-that&quot;&gt;Take 30% out of Every Check for Taxes. And raise your rates to accommodate that.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a freelancer gets paid it’s not a paycheck. No taxes are taken out. It is your responsibility to save for taxes. And as a freelancer you pay, on average, 10% more than your employed friends in taxes. It sucks but at least you are your own boss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That $1000 check is really $700.
That $1500 check is really $1050.
That $500 check is really $350
For my first few months freelancing, I didn’t do the tax math when providing quotes to clients and it hurt me. When I finally got paid for my work, I needed every penny for rent, bills, etc. And then 30% would be taken out. That made getting by only tougher. I had to raise my rates to a point where even with 30% taken out, I could support myself and have a quality life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;as-a-freelancer-you-will-work-longer--harder-than-you-ever-did-at-a-regular-job-but-its-worth-it&quot;&gt;As a freelancer, you will work longer &amp;amp; harder than you ever did at a regular job (but it’s worth it)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by how running my solo-business took over my life. It changed my core personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 23, working an agency job, I went out on weekends. I was concerned about who and what was cool. I’d leave my job and not think about work until I returned the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 24, running my own business, I stopped going out because a) I initially couldn’t afford it and b) there were more important things to do — work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business-side of being a freelancer was the unexpected part-time job I added to my full-time job of website design &amp;amp; development. As a freelancer you are in charge of sending proposals and invoices, creating contracts, emailing clients &amp;amp; marketing yourself to get future work. That takes up a good part of your day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the hard work worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you are in charge of your life. There is no boss that decides your salary, and then won’t consider giving you a raise for another year, maybe two years, maybe three years. I asked for a raise three times, and I got shot down every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After freelancing for a year, I am making 4.5x times the hourly rate I made at my last agency job. The hard work is also worth it because you own your schedule because you own your life. My typical day is working from 8am - 2pm and then 9pm - 12am because those are the times I’m most productive. I can’t be productive from 9 to 5, and I don’t think many people can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take breaks and vacation when I want because opportunities to be with family and friends are always worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the pay and schedule, being a business owner is empowering (even with the long hours and inconsistent cashflow). I can truly say that I love what I do and I love the clients I work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part two will be published next week in my “First Year Full-Time Freelancing” series. In part two I’ll cover months 6-12 when I start to get steady clients and steady money. I’ll discuss how I manage the workload, how I tackle content marketing and how I start to focus my business on clients and projects that I’m the most passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

It's curriculum includes the Foundations of Herbalism course, weekend seminars, intermediate courses, plant walks and more. Botanologos needed a website that featured their events, courses, teachers, literature and more. The website includes a calendar that sells ticketed events, an online shop for their books and courses and a variety of resources for their students."

The Botanologos School of Herbal Studies needed a website that provided information on upcoming events and classes, but also touched on the beauty of nature. Botanologos used images from their local applachain terrain to populate the website. The central plant to Botanologos is the passionflower, and it's imagery is featured throughout the website. The homepage features upcoming classes, testimonials, newsletter sign-up and feature on the owner's book.

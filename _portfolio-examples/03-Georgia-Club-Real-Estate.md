description: "The Georgia Club Real Estate Company, Inc. has sold more homes in The Georgia Club, a private golf community, than any other company. For years, The Georgia Club Real Estate Company sold homes exclusively through the Georgia Club, but in 2018 they stepped out as an independent real estate company. I created an elegant, easy to navigate website to showcase their available homes, floor plans and neighborhoods."

The Georgia Club Real Estate Company sells homes primarily in The Georgia Club, a private golf community located close to Athens, GA, but also sells homes in the surrounding Oconee, Barrow and Jackson counties.
The Georgia Club Real Estate Company website features their available homes for sale, floor plans and Georgia Club neighborhoods.

When selling homes in The Georgia Club, you are not only selling a home but also a lifestyle. The website promotes The Georgia Club lifestyle through images of their scenic grounds, neighborhoods and an informative 'lifestyle' page.

## Available Homes
The available homes section of The Georgia Club Real Estate Company website features an advanced search at the top of the page so users can filter the available homes to their specific needs. There is also a link to the 'available homes' map that provides a map view of all the available homes at The Georgia Club Real Estate Company.

In the available homes feed, each home has an informative preview that features an exterior image, street address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms and the Georgia Club neighborhood.

I've also included a color-coded ledger for the house status (available, sold, under contract), so prospective buyers can quickly filter through the properties.

The individual available home pages features a wealth of information for prosepctive buyers. At the top is the street address, price and main exterior image.

Then there is a grid of important information that shouldn't be lost in a paragraph of text, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, location, square feet, house status, etc.

Below the grid of important information is an interactive google map showing users exactly where the home is located.

Then there is a two-column masonry grid of additional images of the home. If you click on any of these images a pop-up lightbox slider will appear, so you can scroll through all the images.

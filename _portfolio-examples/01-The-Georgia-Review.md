description: The Georgia Review has been around since 1947 with its quarterly publication of essays, poems, art, reviews and interviews. When I came along, their print publication was renowned with an international audience but their website needed some love. They needed a digital publication that was visual and engaging, while being easy to read and navigate. I delivered that for them through updated color scheme and typography, new layouts for visual impact and interactive navigation. I wanted the site to feel the way you do when you get their issues in the mail â€” creative and academic!

description: The University of Georgia's Lamar Dodd School of Art needed a stand-out website for their acclaimed institution. They needed a website that showcased the creative and talented work of their faculty, staff and students. The Lamar Dodd School of Art website was built on the Drupal 8 platform, using a custom Drupal theme. The website includes a calendar of events, news posts, faculty/staff/alumni/student profiles, galleries and much more.

description: The Tiny Yellow Bungalow is an eco-friendly, plastic-free online shop that is curated by founder, Jessie Stokes. For years, Jessie grew her eco-friendly blog and online shop independently. In Fall of 2019 she hired me, a Wordpress and WooCommerce expert, to upgrade the design and functionality of her website. Jessie has built a wonderful community at The Tiny Yellow Bungalow and I'm glad that I'm now a part of it!

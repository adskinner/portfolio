description: "Demmie Hicks is a consultant for executive leaders; guiding them through complexities such as mergers and acquisitions, managing employees and insurance. Demmie Hicks needed a website that captured her energy as a consultant: professional and welcoming. Demmie Hicks' website has a cohesive design that's inspired by nature. This was achieved through custom logo design, photography and web design."

>For Demmie Hicks' consulting website, I had the priviledge to collaborate with other independent professionals in my network for logo design and photography.

[Meredith Elder](https://meredithelder.com/) provided the logo design for Demmie Hicks.

Tatim Kilosky provided the photography for Demmie Hicks.

When I started the design for Demmie Hicks' website, I took inspiration from the already completed logo design and photography for the project. Demmie Hicks wanted the website to combine a masculine and feminine energy in a natural way. I achieved this through a color scheme that did not feature stark white or black, but, rather, colors you could find in nature: ink-filled navy, light beige, orange gold and jade green.

For a consultant or speciality service website, establishing trust with your site visitors is very important. Demmie Hicks' website needed to establish that she is a professional consultant with over 25 years of experience. The copywriting provides the primary information on her expertise, so I made sure the copywriting was easily legible through intentional typography and page layout.

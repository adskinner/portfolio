The *UGA Research* website was a big, collaborative effort on behalf of myself and the UGA Research Office of Communications. For decades, *UGA Research* has been a quarterly magazine that provided the latest in UGA research, discovery and innovation. In 2019, the UGA Research Office of Communications decided to end the printing of *UGA Research* and move the entire publication online at [research.uga.edu/news](https://research.uga.edu/news).

This transformational decision came about because they wanted *UGA Research* to provide the *latest* research news in *all* formats -- longform features, short articles, interactive photo galleries and video.

## Homepage
The homepage for *UGA Research* features the latest in UGA research news through a slideshow of featured stories, featured categories, most popular stories, and featured videos and photo galleries.

When building the homepage, I made sure that every element of the homepage could be updated and re-arranged by the *UGA Research* staff. A publication website needs to be flexible, and I provided that opportunity through custom Wordpress development.

I created a custom side menu that opens when you click the hamburger menu icon. The side menu features custom widgets that can be updated easily by *UGA Research* staff. We decided to include an expanded side menu to keep the primary menu simple and uncluttered. The side menu includes featured categories, social media and newsletter sign up link.

The *UGA Research* publication provides in-depth news on a variety of research topics. On the homepage, there are a few category spotlights -- such as Innovation and Animal Health. The homepage also features a "Most Popular Features" section.

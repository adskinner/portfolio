The 2018 NEH Institute in Digital Technologies in Theatre and Performance Studies took place on the University of Georgia campus in Athens, Georgia between June 17 and 29, 2018. The twenty-five participants included educators from colleges and universities across the United States, from advanced doctoral students to full professors.
The website serves as a digital archive for the lectures and seminars that took place.

The website was built on Drupal 8 and features a custom Drupal theme. The site design has a dark-scale color palette and bold typography, including bold sans-serif headings and monospace subtext.

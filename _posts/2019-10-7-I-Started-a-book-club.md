>Last month I posted on instagram, ‚ÄúWhat if we started a book club?‚Äù and to my surprise a lot of people were very interested (close friends, friends I don‚Äôt see as often and a few that I don‚Äôt know too well yet).

I think a lot of us in our adult lives lose touch with reading. When we are young, reading is encouraged and enforced with compulsory literature classes, summer reading assignments and standardized testing. A lot of this early reading can feel like a chore but every so often magic strikes, and you fall into a book and the book devours you, changes you. It‚Äôs an incredible experience.

As adults, there is no compulsory reading and really no encouragement either. I feel like we‚Äôre pushed to be on our phones all day and compare ourselves to everyone else. We are reading all day but how much of it is valuable, how much of it holds our attention longer than seven seconds?
To put down your phone and pick up a book can feel like a revolutionary act.

That‚Äôs a big reason why so many wanted to join the book club. They used to have a love for reading, but somehow that love hasn‚Äôt followed them into their adult life.

My hope for the book club is that people find their love for reading again. I‚Äôm personally excited to talk about books, read books that I usually wouldn‚Äôt pick out and have a reason to spend time with others.

For our first month, I said I would pick the book and I‚Äôd host book club at my home. I didn‚Äôt expect picking the book would be so stressful!
My criteria for the book was the following:

- available in paperback
- spooky in some way (because October)
- under 400 pages
- page-turner but has depth

After reading many book reviews, I landed on [Station Eleven](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780804172448) by Emily St. John Mandel. It‚Äôs about a traveling theatre group in post-apocalyptic America.
As I‚Äôm writing this, I have not started the book yet. I‚Äôll be starting the book tonight!
Of course, starting a book club made me also want to code a rotating 3D book because why not.

**If you are interested in what else I've read, I post book reviews in my [Instagram story highlights](https://www.instagram.com/a.l.l.is.on/) and I also post my reading on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61939896-allison-skinner.)**

## About the 3D Rotating Book I coded‚Ä¶

I followed SuperHi‚Äôs tutorial [How to make an interactive rotating 3d cube with CSS and Javascript](https://www.superhi.com/video/how-to-make-an-interactive-rotating-3d-cube-with-css-and-javascript). You can view my codepen below or [here](https://codepen.io/adskinner/pen/PoowERX) for the full HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# 2019 What's to Come
>tâ€™s December 2018 and itâ€™s cold and wet in Georgia, which is as close as itâ€™ll ever get to a wintry wonderland. With the year winding down, Iâ€™m thinking of whatâ€™s ahead.
My only short term goal is to finish what I can and then relax with friends and family. After thanksgiving, I donâ€™t take on new work. My only goal is to finish it!
The best thing about a new year is that itâ€™s a chance to start fresh. You can look back on what you did and didnâ€™t accomplish in 2018 and then make new goals for 2019. [Check out my 2018 Year in Review post here](/writing/2018-A-Year-In-Review).
Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll be seeing from Allison Skinner Web Design & Development in 2019.

## Bizness goals

**1. Share my work more**

I havenâ€™t shared new work since November 2017. Which is right about the time I got overbooked for a full year and decided my portfolio site was too outdated to even update. Iâ€™m thankful that I still get business without updating my portfolio, but I wonder what business I *could* be getting if I did update it.

**2. Share and write more about myself and my business**

The freelancers & studios that I connect with the most are the ones that, unsurprisingly, share the most. I want potential clients that are unsure about getting a website redesign to follow me, get to know me and maybe a few months laterâ€¦bite the bullet and contact me about their website! I also want people in the industry, especially those starting out, to follow my writing for motivation and advice.

**3. Expand my client base to Atlanta**

Athens, GA is my home, I love it here. and Iâ€™m grateful to say that most of clients live and work here as well! Athens is a small town, thatâ€™s bustling with creative & entrepreneurial activity â€” and I get to make the websites that showcase it. I want to expand to more Atlanta clients because it means bigger clients and bigger projects, and even creative projects with healthy budgets ðŸ™‚

**4. Spend time to improve workflows**

When you work alone, itâ€™s easy to find a way that works and stick with thatâ€¦forever. Even if thereâ€™s a faster, better way to do it. I want to make time to try out new workflows and approaches. Itâ€™ll be more time intensive on the frontend, but could lead to great improvements.

**5. Spend time experimenting and playing with design and code**

I want to play! Like a kid in sandbox; trying out new effects, languages and designs. I think Iâ€™m in a creative rut. I know how to make an attractive, well-functioning website but sometimes I feel like my work creatively bleeds together, re-using the same tricks and designs from website to website. Most of my clients donâ€™t want the weird stuff, but that doesnâ€™t mean it canâ€™t play around with it!

## Personal goals
1. **Lose 26 lbs (after already losing 10 lb since Nov 1, 2018)** Okay I know this is the most stereotypical New Years Resolution ever, but I weighed myself for the first time in 4 years in November 2018, and it turns out I had gained 36 lbs! So thatâ€™s what I want to lose. I already got a good start in 2018 by doing bootcamp classes at my gym 2-3x a week and then I added 2-3 hot yoga classes a week to the mix. (I also know weight is just a number, and your well-being isn't determined by it. I have very positive body image ðŸ™‚ )
2. **Travel More** I want to go to the west coast and abroad in 2019. Iâ€™ve never been to the west coastâ€¦I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve even seen the Pacific Ocean! So thatâ€™s high on the list. I also want to travel abroad, havenâ€™t been out of the country since my study abroad to Argentina in 2014. My mom and I really want to go to England and Scotland to tour ALL the castles, we are BBC fanatics.
Already have a trip to Asheville in Febuary planned with the fam. Spending two nights at the Grove Park Inn with Jeff for spa & relaxation, then heading to downtown Asheville for two nights with our family for lots of beer and food.
3. **Grow an Incredible Vegetable Garden** Last year, I tried out gardening for the first time with two raised vegetable beds and I had a lot of success (with a few failures). I want to take full advantage of Georgiaâ€™s blessedly long growing seasons and expand my gardening. My dream is to possibly stop spending a fortune at the grocery store because I grow so much on my own! The biggest revelation I had about gardening is that you can buy an 80 cent pack of salad green seeds and have overflowing amounts of salad greens for months. Whereas at the grocery store you can spend $4 on a handful of greens!

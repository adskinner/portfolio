> We’re already halfway through 2019, crazy right?
I’m saying that’s “crazy” when really 2019 has been very…chill. And I like it. I like it a LOT.

I was overbooked and stressed the first half of 2018. I had been overbooked for over 18 months at that point and I was burnt out. By June 2018, I didn’t want to even look at a website, let alone build one.

I also gained weight, lost touch with some of my friends and overall lost my identity outside of work.
I recovered in the second half of 2018 by taking some time off work and making exercise a big part of my life.

I ended 2018 with #goodvibes and I have carried them into 2019.

### What I’m really proud of halfway through 2019:

- I’ve stayed steadily booked but not overbooked
- I’ve saved money
- I’m physically fit for the first time in my life (and down 25 lbs!)
- I’ve read a lot of books
- I launched my new portfolio site (you’re looking at her right now!!)

### What I’d like to improve in the second half of 2019

- Push my site designs. I know the default “easy” website that a lot of my clients want, but I want to reach for the incredible website that my clients wouldn’t be able to imagine.
- Improve workflow/programming knowledge.
- Have a nice-looking yard. It’s the first time I’ve ever wanted this? I want curb appeal??

## Feburary

**On Feburary 1, I turned 26!**
Wooo into the second half of my twenties now.

**Took a trip to Asheville with my family.**
The first two nights, Jeff and I stayed with my family and visited local breweries and restaurants.
The second two nights, Jeff and I stayed at the [Grove Park Inn](https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/asheville-grove-park?&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1MXpBRDjARIsAHtdN-0kfIxPlGvZ2o4k6UBlJOL4gx0sOuV2ovIZjiveG10dmu0RiISfy4YaAglNEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). It was beautiful and so peaceful.

### Launched my portfolio site!
This was a BIG achievement of mine. I build and launch websites all the time for my clients, but launching something of my own was so much work.
My new portfolio site included an overall rebrand, eight new portfolio pieces and updated photography and copy.

## June

![Our sweet angel baby Daisy. Our loved pug.][6]
June began with a devastating loss.

On June 1, Daisy, our sweet pug angel baby, passed. She became very sick and we needed to end her suffering. She went to sleep in Jeff and I’s arms. Her brother Cooper misses her very much.
It still hurts, I’m crying as I write this. We loved her SO much.

## June 30, 2019
### Seven sites launched, 10 books read, one trip taken.

At this point last year (2018) I had launched 10 sites already. But this year (2019) I've made more money. I'm getting smart about this business!!

See you at Christmas with another review!

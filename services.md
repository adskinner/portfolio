## Web Design
I provide web design *and* development for my clients. I make sure your website *looks good* and functions correctly. This means I put a lot of work into the design of your website, which includes color scheme, typography, layout and user interactions. Every website I build has a cohesive design system that reflect's your bussiness' brand and personality.

Every website I design is unique. I do not tweak a template and call it custom web design. When I begin the design of a website, I start with a blank slate and consider the goals of your website.

Do you want to sell products on your website? I will design an online shop that is user friendly and grows brand identity. Do you want leads to contact you for your services? I will design a website with clear contact forms and call-to-actions. Do you want to promote events, workshops or classes? I will design a custom calendar system that allows users to learn about your events, sign up and purchase tickets.

Every website I design is modern, clean and user-friendly with unique details that make your website stand out from your competition.

## Web Development
Web development means I know how to *build* a website. Once you approve the custom design of your website, I will turn that static design into a functioning, usable website.

When I develop a website, I create a custom theme that is pixel perfect to the design mockups. The custom theme allows you to have the flexibility of adding blog posts, events, products, etc. to your website while keeping that design system intact.

In addition to custom theme development, every website I build is responsive, cross browser friendly, optimized for organic SEO growth, has good page performance and is accessible.

Most of my clients maintain and update their own websites. This is possible because I build the website to be user-friendly for those who aren't technical or know how to code. I also provide in-depth documentation packets for each website I build.

## Wordpress Web Development
Most of the websites I build are built on a CMS (content management system). [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most popular CMS and many of my websites are built with Wordpress.

I choose to build many websites on Wordpress because most of my clients are at least familiar with Wordpress and have used it's platform before. Wordpress has the dual benefit of being easy to use on the front end but capable of being completely customizable on the backend.

When building a Wordpress website, I create a custom child theme for your site design. For elements such as an online shop or events calendar, I customize plugins to fit your exact needs.

Every Wordpress website I build is custom yet easy to manage.

## Drupal Web Development
[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is a CMS that is powerful and effective. It has a steep learning curve and sometimes it can be hard to find a Drupal developer for a project. Luckily I have been developing custom Drupal websites for years! My job before starting my own business was being a Drupal developer at an agency.

I have experienced the transition from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 and I can handle site migrations to Drupal 8. In Drupal 8, I provide a custom theme, content types and views.

Drupal is the perfect CMS for complex websites that require advanced sorting, filtering and feeding of content types.

## Shopify Web Development
[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a premium CMS platform that makes running an online shop possible for everyone. Every element of Shopify's platform is tailored for those that want to grow as an online shop.

If you are an online shop, brand identity and trust is very important. Your products are unique and special, so your site should reflect that! When building a Shopify website, I make sure that the process of buying a product is easy and seamless. I also make sure that customers have the opportunity to engage with your brand further through a newsletter sign-up.

I can help you set up your online shop from the administrative details of payment methods and shipping costs to site design details of pop-up forms and product page layouts.

## Organic Search Engine Optimization
How your website looks and functions is important, but it's also important that your website shows up in Google search results. This is called Search Engine Optimization. When I build a website, I make sure that your website is set up for success in *organic* search growth. Organic, in this case, means free. I do not specialize in "pay-per-click" SEO strategies such as google ads.

The primary SEO work I provide is on-page optimization that propels organic search visibility. I make sure that your website has clean site structure, with logical URL paths, has appropriate page titles and meta descriptions, and that each image I add to your website has an appropriate ALT description. I provide consultation to copywriters for appropriate keyword usage. I also make sure that your website loads quickly -- Google gives you extra points if your site runs fast!

Once your site has launched, I will create a [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) account and [Google Search console account](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) for your website. From these accounts you can monitor your site traffic and the Google searches that lead to your site.

After your site has launched, you will be the determining variable is your site's SEO success. The best way to drive SEO growth is by providing consistent, valuable content on your website and having other credible websites link to your website.

## Email Newsletter Set-Up and Design
Email newsletters are a great way for you to keep engaged with your customers. Newsletters can provide valuable and exclusive updates, right in your customer's inbox!

There is a learning curve to newsletter set-up and design, and I have helped many clients overcome it by providing email newsletter services.
I can help you set up your email newsletter account (I typically use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) and I can design a variety of templates for you to use.
I test all the templates to make sure they are responsive and email client friendly.
